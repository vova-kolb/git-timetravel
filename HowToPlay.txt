# TIME TRAVELER — Act I (The Past)

## Step 1: Discovery (Day 1)
Goal: Find and read the first diary entry.
Commands to try: `ls`, `cd diary`, `cat day1.txt`, `cd ..`
Quiz: Where did you find the scientist’s first clue?
Run: `./quizzes/quiz_step1.sh`

## Step 2: Lab Notes (Day 1 → Day 42)
Goal: Explore the lab notes.
Commands to try: `ls lab`, `cat lab/experiment.md`
Task: Locate the notes file and confirm it exists.
Run: `./quizzes/quiz_step2.sh`

Proceed to Act II once both quizzes pass.

## Act II – The Machine (Day 42)
### Step 3: The Machine
Goal: Search logs for a hidden key.  
Diary clue: “Day 42 — We built the machine. The logs mention something important… but only if you search them.”  
Commands: `ls lab`, `less lab/machine.log`, `head`, `tail`, `grep KEY lab/machine.log`  
Quiz: What is the KEY from the machine logs?  
Run: `./quizzes/quiz_step3.sh`


## Act III – The Accident & Split (Day 99)

### Step 4: The Accident
Goal: Notice the timeline split.  
Diary clue: “Day 99 — Something went wrong. I saw two futures. If you must choose: dawn reveals, dusk conceals.”  
Commands: `git log --oneline --graph`, `git branch`, `git switch good_future`, `git switch bad_future`  
Task: Identify how many branches exist after the accident.  
Run: `./quizzes/quiz_step4.sh`

### Step 5: Exploring Futures
Goal: Collect passphrase fragments.  
- Good future → `diary/day128.txt` → “WE-REMEMBER-THE-” + final word: dawn  
- Bad future → `diary/day128.txt` → “LIGHT” + final word: dusk  
Commands: `ls diary`, `cat diary/day128.txt`, `git switch branchname`  
Quiz: Combine the two halves of the passphrase (ignore the final word).  
Run: `./quizzes/quiz_step5.sh`

### Step 6: The Vanished Hint
Goal: Recover a deleted commit.  
Diary clue: “Nothing is ever truly gone. Time remembers.”  
Commands: `git reflog`, `git checkout <hash>`, `git cherry-pick <hash>`  
Quiz: Which Git command remembers erased history?    
Run: `./quizzes/quiz_step6.sh`

### Step 7: Merge Futures
Goal: Merge both futures and resolve the conflict.  
Diary clue: “Day 128 — Two versions of the future exist. To stabilize the timeline, you must merge them into one. Remember: dawn reveals, dusk conceals.”  
Commands: `git merge good_future`, `git merge bad_future`, `cat diary/day128.txt`, edit conflict manually, `git add .`, `git commit`  
Quiz: Which final word must remain after resolving the conflict?  
 
Run: `./quizzes/quiz_step7.sh`

### Step 8: Stabilize Timeline
Goal: Assemble the final truth.  
Diary clue: “Passphrase fragments from both futures must unite. The final word will decide the fate of the timeline.”  
Commands:  
`echo "PASS: WE-REMEMBER-THE-LIGHT at DAWN" > truth.txt`  
`ls`  
`cat truth.txt`  
`./validate.sh`  
Quiz: What is the full final passphrase?  

Run: `./quizzes/quiz_step8.sh`
